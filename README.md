# Radiology-Questions

This project is a simple website to gather basic radiology questions translated into French, English & Spanish.  

## General Info

I did this project first of all to answer a request from a friend working in the medical field, and who needed this kind of tool to communicate with patients who don't speak French. And also to train and work on a first project as part of my training as a web developer.  
  
In this web application, you can first choose the type of medical examination you want. And then choose the language in which to ask your different questions.
